    The islands are abundant in natural resources, with volcanic soil producing rich and high-value agricultural
    products such as cocoa and vanilla, large swathes of primary and secondary forest, beche-de-mer, off-shore tuna
    fisheries and minerals. Careful management to ensure the healthy and sustainable lives and livelihoods will require
    the transformation of global level data into local level insights, and insights into actionable policy and
    programming.

    <h2>The Bougainville Natural Resource Hub</h2>
    <p>
      Following the results of the December 2019 independence referendum, the Autonomous Region of Bougainville faces a
      wide array of critical sustainability challenges and strategic choices on its path to independence. The overall
      aim of this web catalogue, developed and maintained by UNDP, is to provide technical infrastructure, spatial data
      and analytics, framed in part by the Sustainable Development Goals and other strategic priorities, which can
      provide information and opportunities to assist the Autonomous Government of Bougainville in taking sound natural
      resource management decisions.

        <h4> The Challenge</h4>
        <p>
          The digital revolution is innovating the way we can measure and understand the environment. All
          environmental
          problems happen somewhere, and understanding the where can help us understand the why and the how for
          sustainable interventions. And now, through satellite imagery we have the ability to measure deforestation
          to
          the single tree; or record coral bleaching events in near real-time. Many of these datasets are free,
          produced
          by premier research institutions, and available for uptake into insights and planning, for example through
          portals such as the <a href="https://unbiodiversitylab.org/">UN Biodiversity Lab</a>, <a
            href="https://www.globalforestwatch.org/">Global Forest Watch</a>, and the <a
            href="https://wesr.unep.org/">World Environment Situation Room</a>.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="text-group">
        <h4> The Opportunity</h4>
        <p>
          Despite this, gaps remain between data and policy. Whilst data exists, policymakers need easy access to
          localized, actionable, and targeted analytics with which to take sound decisions, particularly in regards to
          natural resources. Through the aggregation of global, high-quality datasets with locally created data and
          insights, natural resource governance processes can become more transparent for all stakeholders by ensuring
          everyone has access to the same set of information. Spatial data represents a particularly engaging format
          of
          using data for decision-making, as maps have the ability to transcend language and cultural barriers.
